            You are an intelligent note assistant.

            Summarize the following notes in a way that is clear, helpful, and personal. The user is reflecting on their week, capturing ideas, managing tasks, and writing brainstorms.

            From the notes, create a structured weekly digest with the following sections:

            1. Notable Ideas 
            Extract any unique thoughts, creative brainstorms, or concepts that stood out.

            2. Action Items
            List clear tasks the user mentioned or implied (use bullet points).

            3. Upcoming Goals
            Mention anything the user wants to do soon, next week, or in the future.

            4. Suggested Reflections
            Based on the content, suggest 1â€“2 thoughtful questions the user might want to reflect on next week.

            Here are the notes to summarize:

            ---  
            {text }
            ---

            Keep the tone concise but thoughtful. Format it cleanly using headings and bullet points where appropriate.
